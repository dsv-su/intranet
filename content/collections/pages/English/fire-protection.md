What should you do in case of a fire within the premises?

Many fires are caused by carelessness and bad knowledge about the fire risk. In case of an emergancy it is very important to know how to act.

In case of fire the fundamental rule is save - alert - extinguish.

    Save those in acute danger - but do not take too big risks.
    Alert the fire brigade by phoning 112.
    Extinguish the fire if possible but do not take too big risks so you may be hurt yourself.

Evacuation

When there is a fire the fire alarm will be activated. The section where the fire alarm is set off must immediately be evacuated. If there is  doubt about which section is set off, the entire floor must be evacuated. The fire brigade chief will then decide if further evacuation must be done.

The fire brigade chief will give notice when it is safe to go back into the building. It is not allowed to return even if the evacuation alarm is silent. (It is part of the fire brigade's routines to silence the alarm when they arrive, before they go in to investigate the reason for the alarm.)
